# LeapCV
LeapCV is an open source framework that aims to bridge the gap between developers of Leap Motion Controller applications and OpenCV. The idea is to make it easier for someone that wants to get into computer vision, to do so.

The Leap Motion Controller is made up of two stereoscopic fisheye lens cameras. Leap Motion have now allowed camera raw image access to their LeapSDK meaning that frameworks such as LeapCV can be created.

This framework is still very young, having been born out of a university undergraduates final year project. It is believed that it might be useful to someone though!
